# Finding Donors for Charity

## Overview
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley. This project aims to analyze and predict potential donors' willingness to contribute to the charity. By employing machine learning techniques, we can identify individuals most likely to donate to the cause.

## Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and format the dataset to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize the data to understand trends and patterns.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluate different algorithms to find the most effective one for our prediction task.
- **Training and Testing**: Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure model reliability.
- **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to measure the model's performance.

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
